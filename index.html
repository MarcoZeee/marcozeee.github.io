        <h1>Marco Zee</h1>
        <p>
          "Getting into a new world is indeed daunting." Marco, who serves as a
          mentoship function in art education, expresses his concern when
          thinking of changing. Change is never an easy step. When he had his
          first job, he had never thought that this day would happen: "At the
          very first, I thought talking to young people about his interests and
          life is my passion", he adds, "day after day, every single time after
          exhaustive toil in the office, I start to think more. Maybe technology
          can help me with better solution and quicker response."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he realized it's a bigger world than anything else human beings
          could imagine. Computer science is so cool, and many technologies can
          resolve too many issues that previously couldn't be settled.
        </p>
        <p>
          ***This is the website dedicated to showcasing the work of Marco. In
          summary,

          is used to interpret and analyze him as a strategist and a developer.
          From a front-end development point of view, he incorporates UX design
          and coding(HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to ensure the website is
          neat and usable. He believes the internet is a better place when we
          care and share.

          <h2>
            Setting the strategic objective and imagining the 'next big thing'
          </h2>
          <p>
            While the traditional front end development job requires only
            programming skill, the contemporary front-end entails more work on
            building a better user experience. In my case, I do believe that the
            tranisition from prgrammer to developer is a real challenge for
            everyone, and full stack is not the only pathway for anyone who's
            interested in advancing their career as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future of this professional path, however, lies in the
            combination of both and sometimes even more expertise such as
            knowledge on strategy and management. My plan is, learning the most
            widespread technologies for now, to help the companies especially in
            education and other knnowledge intense industries with more
            responsive apps and websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowledge based industries are facing severe challenges right now,
            and the traditional way of delivering such products can be daunting
            for companies in transition. Therefore, a more holistic approach
            should be accepted by the community of tech and education or maybe
            sometimes, consulting sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            New competitor usually emerges from other industries. Take Duolingo
            as an example. The language learning platform uses cutting edge
            UI/UX design and proper technologies to make their product more
            tangible. Should other education companies worry about it? There's
            always a game changer around the corner, and the only thing we know
            is that it will happen, regardless of knowing what, when and how.
            Whereas staying focused is not enough, we ought to stay alert and
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what about planning? Should we more concern about plans? Nobody
            can predict what's gonna happen next exactly, instead, what we do is
            to provide insights on visions and directions. So let me rewind, my
            objective is to keep learning new technologies. The final goal?
            Irrevelency can be kept at bay.

          <h2>Why Diversification is still the best strategy?</h2>
          <p>
            What is Diversification? In
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansoff_Matrix"
              >Ansoff's publication</a
            >, he describes it as one of the four strategies in the matrix to
            gain the competitive advantage. In this definition, both
            organization and person can benefit from this theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            What many education and knowledge intensive companies do is to
            penetrate the market, or so we called "rivalry". Harvard to Yale,
            big four consulting to each other, these are all rivalries. They are
            doing the same thing in the same industry for ages. Can any
            customers tell them apart if they don't know where the product they
            use is from? Do they offer distinct service for the public?
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just for corporates, but individuals are facing the same dillema as well on a daily basis. Should I stand out and be unique? Or should I fit in and be compatible with the mass. Those are real questions being thought off for many employees. As a singe entity and a candidate, he ought to have the obligation of being unique and distinctive; yet when it comes to hiring the right person for a certain position, decision makers tend to stick with the same pattern. For me they are not finding the right candidate, instead they are seeking the most compliant one within the group of predetermined "qualified" pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be a jarring process and never ending loophole. From my perspective, both company and the candidate should emerge from the crowd and be unique. Therefore, for those companies suffer from lack of originality and uniqueness, they deserve mundane workers.

          <h2>Generalist vs specialist, which one is better?</h2>
          <p>
            The labour of division occurred after industrial revolution helps us with better living standard and more efficiency. The society we live in is divided by different jobs. The most common question we ask someone we just met right after “what’s your name” is “What do you do?” A certain job means a lot to us, and more specialized we are we are better at our job as the public presumes. But still we ask can we be a “generalist” and still be good at it?

          </p>
          <p>
            “Generalist” doesn’t mean one is good at nothing but more so is the case that one is good at 2 to 3 things. Being great at one thing is something to be proud of indeed, but when one can manage up to 3 expertises at the same time, it shows a lot of enthusiasm and dedication to learning. Learning, especially learning after school is no easy job no matter one explore the field he majors in school or something really interests him as a more mature person.

          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t get me wrong, I will not look down upon specialists who dedicate decades doing the same thing. Instead, employers should send kudos to one who discovers technologies and himself and eventually becomes a generalist. Generalist have the strengths that other specialists never manage to unleash.

          <h2>
            Why startup will thrive when hire generalist?

          </h2>
          <p>
            First of all, let’s define what is startup. Not every small sized companies are startups, and to be one, it requires entrepreneurship. However we all speak of this buzz word when no one seems to understand what it means. To be precise, being an entrepreneur indicates creative elements, and creativeness asks for learning.

          </p>
          <p>
            That’s exactly why startup should always hire generalists. Both parties’ strategic objective is to learn, to explore and to grow. Throughout the years in the industry, all decision makers at startups I know have the mission to disrupt and they refuse to accept the statues quo. Why? Because although change is risky, they still set the goal to make a difference, and because they  try their best to avoid spending their rest of life on serving for a big tech company. The same logic can apply to generalists. 

          </p>
          <p>
            As a generalist, I can say when both managers and employees have the same mission statement, the company will drive the best out of people and a new and more powerful corporate culture will emerge.

          <h2>
            What most of developers lack in a disruptive world?

          </h2>
          <p>
            The recent pandemic is disruptive enough, but do you know what’s more disruptive? Ever-changing technology can make a huge amount of population obsolete. When it comes to technology world, developers are the most vulnerable demographic. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Aren’t developers the most forward thinking people in the industry? The reality is that most of so called developers are not developing anything, and all they do is coding and programming. There’s huge difference between the two, and one is that developers serve a purpose to be user-centred. To be a true developer, one not only has to constantly learn new technologies, but he has the means to put users on the pedestal. 

          </p>
          <p>
            Always, the case is that developers use those fancy elements on the app or website to prove the product is fantastic. However, the trend “less is more” says the simple and straightforward design serves the purpose better if the purpose itself is to make customers experience significantly better when using the product. This, I think, is one important trait most of developers lack in this disruptive world.

            Case study: KONUX</a>'s
            entry strategy in APAC
          </h2>
          <h3>Executive summary</h3>
          <p>
            In this report, the question about the best competitive strategy for
            KONUX should be assessed, analyzed and discussed, and the more
            specific question would be: How could a successful entry strategy
            for an attractive, new market look like?
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the company has much economic presence in EU and NA, they
            still have opportunity to enter other growing markets such as APAC.
            When the global pandemic is hitting UK and North America pretty
            hard, it’s not illogical to think of a new way for the company to
            generate extra revenue, considering the workers and factories in
            Chinese and other East Asian countries resumed operation almost half
            a year ago. Entering the China market becomes the trend while many
            international companies already heavily invested and ready to invest
            more in the near future. APAC and China recover quicker and more
            effectively from the outbreak, and designing a certain strategy for
            this market is viable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution to this, it turns out, is a three step long term
            strategy: <strong>Blue Ocean Initiative, Acquisition and lastly Global
            strategy</strong>. These three steps can build up a competitive advantage
            when it comes to entering a new market with existing product.
