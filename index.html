        <p>
          This is the website dedicated to showcasing the work of Marco. In
          summary,
          <a

            >Mintzberg's 5P on strategy</a
          >
          is used to interpret and analyze him as a strategist and a developer.
          From a front-end development point of view, he incorporates UX design
          and coding(HTML, CSS and Vanila JavaScript) to ensure the website is
          neat and usable. He believes the internet is a better place when we
          care and share.

          "Getting into a new world is indeed daunting." Marco, who serves as a
          mentoship function in art education, expresses his concern when
          thinking of changing. Change is never an easy step. When he had his
          first job, he had never thought that this day would happen: "At the
          very first, I thought talking to young people about his interests and
          life is my passion", he adds, "day after day, every single time after
          exhaustive toil in the office, I start to think more. Maybe technology
          can help me with better solution and quicker response."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he realized it's a bigger world than anything else human beings
          could imagine. Computer science is so cool, and many technologies can
          resolve too many issues that previously couldn't be settled.

          <h2>
            Setting the strategic objective and imagining the 'next big thing'
          </h2>
          <p>
            While the traditional front end development job requires only
            programming skill, the contemporary front-end entails more work on
            building a better user experience. In my case, I do believe that the
            tranisition from prgrammer to developer is a real challenge for
            everyone, and full stack is not the only pathway for anyone who's
            interested in advancing their career as a developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future of this professional path, however, lies in the
            combination of both and sometimes even more expertise such as
            knowledge on strategy and management. My plan is, learning the most
            widespread technologies for now, to help the companies especially in
            education and other knnowledge intense industries with more
            responsive apps and websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowledge based industries are facing severe challenges right now,
            and the traditional way of delivering such products can be daunting
            for companies in transition. Therefore, a more holistic approach
            should be accepted by the community of tech and education or maybe
            sometimes, consulting sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            New competitor usually emerges from other industries. Take Duolingo
            as an example. The language learning platform uses cutting edge
            UI/UX design and proper technologies to make their product more
            tangible. Should other education companies worry about it? There's
            always a game changer around the corner, and the only thing we know
            is that it will happen, regardless of knowing what, when and how.
            Whereas staying focused is not enough, we ought to stay alert and
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what about planning? Should we more concern about plans? Nobody
            can predict what's gonna happen next exactly, instead, what we do is
            to provide insights on visions and directions. So let me rewind, my
            objective is to keep learning new technologies. The final goal?
            Irrevelency can be kept at bay.

          <h2>Why Diversification is still the best strategy?</h2>
          <p>
            What is Diversification? In
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansoff_Matrix"
              >Ansoff's publication</a
            >, he describes it as one of the four strategies in the matrix to
            gain the competitive advantage. In this definition, both
            organization and person can benefit from this theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            What many education and knowledge intensive companies do is to
            penetrate the market, or so we called "rivalry". Harvard to Yale,
            big four consulting to each other, these are all rivalries. They are
            doing the same thing in the same industry for ages. Can any
            customers tell them apart if they don't know where the product they
            use is from? Do they offer distinct service for the public?

            Case study: <a href="https://www.konux.com/about-us/">KONUX</a>'s
            entry strategy in APAC
          </h2>
          <h3>Executive summary</h3>
          <p>
            In this report, the question about the best competitive strategy for
            KONUX should be assessed, analyzed and discussed, and the more
            specific question would be: How could a successful entry strategy
            for an attractive, new market look like?
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the company has much economic presence in EU and NA, they
            still have opportunity to enter other growing markets such as APAC.
            When the global pandemic is hitting UK and North America pretty
            hard, itâ€™s not illogical to think of a new way for the company to
            generate extra revenue, considering the workers and factories in
            Chinese and other East Asian countries resumed operation almost half
            a year ago. Entering the China market becomes the trend while many
            international companies already heavily invested and ready to invest
            more in the near future. APAC and China recover quicker and more
            effectively from the outbreak, and designing a certain strategy for
            this market is viable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution to this, it turns out, is a three step long term
            strategy: Blue Ocean Initiative, Acquisition and lastly Global
            strategy. These three steps can build up a competitive advantage
            when it comes to entering a new market with existing product.
